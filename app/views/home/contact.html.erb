  We're here to help you with sourceAFIRCA accounts or questions about the service. There are several ways to get in touch with us; check the section below that best fits what you need.

  <h2>Getting a sourceAFIRCA account</h2>
  <p>Currently, sourceAFIRCA is available to anyone who reports on primary source documents. Most users are in news organizations, but we do provide accounts for those who do document-based investigative reporting outside of a traditional newsroom. If that's you, we'd be glad to have you join. Please show us some of your reporting and tell us about the kind of documents you work with.</p>
  
  <p>To get an account:</p>
  
  <p>If your organization is already a sourceAFRICA contributor, a person at your site with administrative privileges on sourceAFRICA can create an account for you. If you don't know who that is, we can help you. Email us at <a href="mailto:support@codeforafrica.org?subject=sourceAFIRCA+Account+Help">support@codeforafrica.org</a>.
  
  <p>If your organization is not yet a sourceAFRICA contributor, you can <a href="mailto:info@codeforafrica.org?subject=sourceAFRICA+Joining">request an account</a>. We ask two things of prospective users: permission to add your newsroom to our public list of <a href="/contributors">document contributors</a> and a note (email is fine) from your editor or editorial director confirming that they understand you'll be contributing documents to a public catalog and approve your participation in sourceAFRICA. Once we get the go-ahead from your editor, expect to be up and running within two weeks.</p>
